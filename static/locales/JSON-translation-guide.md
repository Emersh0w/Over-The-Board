# JSON Translation Guide

This document explains how to properly format translation files (`.json`) for use in the Over the Board project. The format is designed to be clean, consistent, and easy to use for translators‚Äîboth technical and non-technical‚Äîvia platforms such as Crowdin.

---

## ‚úÖ File Format

Translation files are plain JSON files, one per language. Example structure:

```
/locales/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pt.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fr.json
```

Each file contains a flat list of keys and their corresponding translated strings.

## ‚úÖ Key Naming Conventions

Use **dot notation** and **camelCase** to organize keys clearly:

### Structure:

```
<section>.<subSection>.<camelCaseKey>
```

### Examples:

```json
"home.title": "Over the Board - Dashboard",
"players.subTitle": "Search players by state",
"tournaments.month.january": "January"
```

### Rules:

* Use `.` (dots) to represent hierarchy (like sections and subsections)
* Use `camelCase` for compound words: `currentTime`, `subTitle`, `loggedInUser`
* Avoid `snake_case` or `kebab-case`
* Do not include trailing punctuation or symbols in keys

---

## ‚úÖ Value Formatting

Values should:

* Be full, human-readable sentences or phrases
* Use proper punctuation and capitalization
* Not include HTML or Markdown unless explicitly required

### Example:

```json
"home.welcome": "Welcome to the Over the Board"
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                     | Explanation                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `home_title`                                | Use `home.title` instead       |
| `home-current-time`                         | Use `home.currentTime` instead |
| Keys with trailing colons like `home.time:` | Avoid colons in keys           |
| Untranslated fallback text in English file  | Every value must be translated |

---

## üí° Tips for Translators

* Translate only the values (text after the colon `:`), never the keys
* Make sure the translated phrase fits the same context as the original
* If you're unsure about a term (e.g., "Rating" or "Cache"), ask the project manager for clarification

## ‚úÖ Testing Translations

After updating the translation file:

1. Save your changes
2. Ensure the file is valid JSON (use an online JSON validator)
3. If working via Git, commit and push the changes
4. If working via Crowdin, the platform will validate automatically
